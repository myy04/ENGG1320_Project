Cellini's Perseus with the Head of Medusa depicts the mythical king of Mycenae, son of Jove and
Danae, who stands triumphantly after decapitating the gorgon Medusa. Perseus stands on top of
Medusa's writhing body, with his weight on his right leg, and his left
delicately bent at the knee_
Medusa is contorted into a dehumanized circular mass, her left hand clutching at her right angle. The
gorgon's body reads like an inanimate heap of limbs
-the body of the dualistic being, divorced from its
vital animus. Perseus's left foot rests triumphantly on the vanquished monster's stomach. In his left
hand, he holds aloft the potent severed head; in his right; he firmly holds the instrument of decapitation,
the curved blade, perpendicular to his nude torso. It is worth noting that Cellini renders the blade as
curved-~suggesting that the artist was paying close attention to
and faithfully rendering_his source
the Metemorphoses, in which Ovid briefly mentions a curved blade_
The hero's face is downcast, stoic
in
victory: Medusa's mouth is slightly agape. Her eyes are almost closed, but not quite, suggesting that
she is still in the process of dying_in the quintessentially Ovidian state of liminal metamorphosis, per-
petual non finito (unfinished-ness) 2 This is also suggested by the profusion of blood pouring from either
end of the severed neck:
It is as if Medusa is dripping vital energy; which is also necessarily generative
energy in the mythographic logos of Perseus and Medusa:
Slung across the hero's otherwise nude
torso is a band, bearing the artist's name in large Latinate lettering: In this presentation of the myth,
Cellini is demonstrably concerned with self-aggrandizement; an inclination to which Ovid's poetic exam-
ple lends apt rhetorical ammunition and justification
as Ovid's
metamorphoses, being an epic of cre-
ations and transformations, was (and is) frequently interpreted as
about the act of poeticlartistic
creation itself.4
